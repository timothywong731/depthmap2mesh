# Depthmap to 3D Mesh Converter for CNC Milling

This repository provides a Python function to convert a depthmap image into a 3D mesh suitable for CNC milling. The function allows you to specify the physical dimensions of the design, control the mesh resolution, and ensures that the mesh is correctly oriented and enclosed for CNC operations.

## Features

- Converts grayscale depthmap images to 3D meshes.
- Allows specification of design dimensions: width, depth, and base thickness.
- Offers control over mesh resolution to balance detail and performance.
- Correctly aligns image orientation with the mesh coordinate system.
- Generates an enclosed, watertight mesh suitable for CNC milling.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/)
- [trimesh](https://trimsh.org/)

## Installation

Install the required Python packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pillow trimesh
```

## Usage

### Function Definition

The main function provided is `depthmap_to_3d_mesh`, which converts a depthmap image to a 3D mesh and exports it as an STL file.

```python
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image
import trimesh

def depthmap_to_3d_mesh(depthmap_path, stl_path, width, depth, base_thickness, mesh_resolution=None):
    # Function implementation goes here
```

### Parameters

- `depthmap_path` (str): Path to the depthmap image file (grayscale image).
- `stl_path` (str): Path to save the output STL file.
- `width` (float): Width of the design in millimeters (mm).
- `depth` (float): Maximum carving depth in millimeters (mm).
- `base_thickness` (float): Minimum thickness to leave at the base in millimeters (mm).
- `mesh_resolution` (int or tuple, optional):
  - If an integer is provided, it specifies the number of vertices along the width (`width_res`), and the height resolution is calculated automatically to maintain the aspect ratio.
  - If a tuple `(width_res, height_res)` is provided, both resolutions are used.
  - If `None`, the original image resolution is used.

### Example

```python
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image
import trimesh

def depthmap_to_3d_mesh(depthmap_path, stl_path, width, depth, base_thickness, mesh_resolution=None):
    # [Function implementation as provided in the assistant's previous message]
    # Ensure the implementation code is included here.

# Example usage
depthmap_path = 'path/to/your/depthmap_image.png'  # Replace with your depthmap image path
stl_path = 'path/to/save/output_mesh.stl'          # Replace with your desired output path

# Design parameters
width = 150           # Width of the design in mm
depth = 8             # Maximum carving depth in mm
base_thickness = 11   # Minimum thickness at the base in mm
mesh_resolution = 100 # Number of vertices along the width; height resolution is calculated automatically

# Generate the 3D mesh
depthmap_to_3d_mesh(
    depthmap_path,
    stl_path,
    width,
    depth,
    base_thickness,
    mesh_resolution
)
```

## Visualization

To verify the generated mesh before proceeding to CNC milling, you can visualize it using `trimesh`:

```python
import trimesh

# Load and display the mesh
mesh = trimesh.load(stl_path)
mesh.show()
```

## Notes

- **Coordinate System Alignment**: The function sets the top of the stock at `z = 0` and carves into negative `z` values, aligning with standard CNC milling practices.
- **Image Orientation**:
  - The depthmap image is flipped vertically (`np.flipud`) to match the mesh coordinate system.
  - Ensure that the depthmap image is correctly oriented; if the design appears inverted, you may need to adjust the image or the code accordingly.
- **Depthmap Interpretation**:
  - **White pixels** (`value = 255`): Represent the highest points (no carving, `z = 0`).
  - **Black pixels** (`value = 0`): Represent the lowest points (maximum carving depth, `z = -depth`).
- **Mesh Resolution**:
  - Higher `mesh_resolution` values produce more detailed meshes but require more processing power.
  - Adjust `mesh_resolution` to balance between detail and performance.
- **Base Thickness**:
  - The mesh ensures there is a `base_thickness` of material left at the bottom.
  - The total thickness of the mesh is `base_thickness + depth`.

## Troubleshooting

- **Design Appears Flipped**:
  - If the design is flipped horizontally or vertically, adjust the image orientation or modify the code by adding or removing `np.fliplr` or `np.flipud`.
- **Mesh Not Watertight**:
  - Ensure that all faces are correctly defined.
  - Use `mesh.is_watertight` to check the mesh integrity:
    ```python
    if not mesh.is_watertight:
        print("Warning: The generated mesh is not watertight.")
    else:
        print("The mesh is watertight and ready for CNC milling.")
    ```
- **Performance Issues**:
  - Reduce the `mesh_resolution` to simplify the mesh.
  - Ensure your system has sufficient resources to handle high-resolution meshes.
